Welcome to blackblox's documentation!
=====================================

Blackblox is an open source python3 library for constructing and solving "black box" process models. Its particular strength is allowing for rapid comparison of different scenarios of parameters. Input data can be stored in Excel workbooks or tab or comma deliniated text files. Results are returned as dictonaries for use within python and written to Excel workbooks. Results can also be displayed on the terminal console. BlackBlox's basic functionality can be run from the terminal without needing to write any Python script.
