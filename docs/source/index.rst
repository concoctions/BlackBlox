Welcome to blackblox's documentation!
=====================================

Blackblox is an open source python3 library for constructing and solving "black box" process models. Its particular strength is allowing for rapid comparison of different scenarios of parameters. Input data can be stored in Excel workbooks or tab or comma deliniated text files. Results are returned as dictonaries for use within python and written to Excel workbooks. Results can also be displayed on the terminal console. BlackBlox's basic functionality can be run from the terminal without needing to write any Python script.

The `blackblox package <https://pypi.org/project/blackblox/>`_ can be found on PyPi at `https://pypi.org/project/blackblox/ <https://pypi.org/project/blackblox/>`_.

The `blackblox source code <https://github.com/concoctions/BlackBlox>`_ can be found and forked on GitHub at `https://github.com/concoctions/BlackBlox <https://github.com/concoctions/BlackBlox>`_.

Blackblox and its documentation is under active development.

Blackblox was created by `S.E. Tanzer <https://www.tudelft.nl/tbm/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-systems-and-services/people/phd-candidates/ir-se-samantha-tanzer>`_, as part of her dissertation "Negative Emissions in the Industrial Sector", at the department of `Engineering Systems and Services <https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/about-the-faculty/departments/engineering-systems-and-services>`_, `Faculty of Technology Policy, Management <https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm>`_, `Delft University of Technology <https://www.tudelft.nl/en/>`_, between 2017-2022.


Blackblox was used as the basis of research concerning the use of bioenergy and carbon capture and storage in `steel <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2020.103104>`_, `chemicals <http://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3819778>`_, and `concrete <http://doi.org/10.1039/D0FD00139B>`_, all publication of which are available open-access. A list of publications associated with this modelling software can be found `here <research.html>`_.
