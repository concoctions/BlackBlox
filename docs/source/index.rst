Black Box Modeling in Python
=============================

This is the documentation for the nascent BlackBlox.py, which aims to faciliate
the creation and exploration of black box models of aribitrary levels of details
by automating mass and energy balances and generation of pretty (and not so pretty)
figures.

This is currently a private project and very much a work-in-progress.
